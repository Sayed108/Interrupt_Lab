# Interrupt_Lab
With using  timer interrupt , Lm35 (Temprature sensor) ,LCD 2*16 and DC fan , An interrupt is executed when the temperature reaches 50 degrees or higher. The ISR sends a signal that operates the fan and keeps working until the temperature is back below 50 degrees and display the elipsaed time
